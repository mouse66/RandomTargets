    <string name="program_name">Random targets application</string>
        <string name="main_1">This application contributes to development of cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, reaction efficiency, and also to higher stress resistance and effective decision-making</string>
        <string name="main_2">The skills development is assured through the generation of commands base/system for target layout and environment used within training process</string>
        <string name="main_3">During the operation the application randomly choose any task of accessible types. The tasks can include pictures, text and audio commands. In “Settings” the user can choose tasks types used while application operation</string>
        <string name="main_4">For higher commands effectiveness you can ask your coach or partner to compose tasks so that you don’t become acquainted with them in advance as likely as you composed them yourself</string>

        <string name="examples_1">The tasks diversity depends on target types, environment and user’s imagination. A task may include not only firing exercises of different degree of complexity, but physical exercises and their combinations. A part of tasks can be formed as pictorial puzzles for development of the mental agility</string>
